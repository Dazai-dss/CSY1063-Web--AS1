            <h2>Learning Web Development</h2>
            <p> Learning web development was really amazing experience and yet also quite challenging in the early path. I started with the basics of HTML and CSS and it was really amazing how interesting web development can be.</p>

            <h2>Project experience</h2>
            <p> Early on I faced quite challenges regarding the structure and designs for the web pages. Every element was bind with each other and was equally important for every thing. Getting messsed up in a particular element meant your website could break as it should be welly placed and selected. </p>

            <h2>Design Decision and influences</h2>
            <p> For the designing the website I chose for light color tone which would be better in any situation and can be simple and practical.<p>

            <h2>Validation Reports</h2>
            <p>For the validation report I chose to check the validity of my codes using W3C validation tool.</p>

            <p>It was really fun and yet also challenging project which greatly improved my skills and experience. Having to finish this project was both a hard but also rewarding one.</p>
